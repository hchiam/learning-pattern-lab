# Learning Pattern Lab

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://patternlab.io>

<https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node>

```bash
npm create pattern-lab
```

For templating syntax, I prefer [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) over [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).

View patterns: `npm run pl:serve`

Patterns be here: `/source/_patterns`

You can edit the files and the page will reload, and auto-generate the HTML.
