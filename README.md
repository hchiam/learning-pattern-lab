# Learning Pattern Lab

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://patternlab.io>

<https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node>

```bash
npm create pattern-lab
```

For templating syntax, I prefer [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) over [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).
